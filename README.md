# Heart Disease Detection
### About the Data set

This dataset gives the information realated to heart disease. Dataset contain 13 columns, target is the class variable which is affected by other 12 columns. Here the aim is to classify the target variable to (disease\non disease) using different machine learning algorithm and findout which algorithm suitable for this dataset.


### Algorithms Used:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Extreme Gradient Boost
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Support Vector Machine

### Features Information:

* Age : age in years
* Sex : 1 = male; 0 = female
* CP  : chest pain type
* TRESTBPS : resting blood pressure (in mm * Hg on admission to the hospital)
* CHOL : serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* FPS : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
* RESTECH : resting electrocardiographic results
* THALACH : maximum heart rate achieved
* EXANG : exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* OLDPEAK : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* SLOPE : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* CA : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
* THAL : 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* TARGET : 1 or 0
